Weston's Portfolio - This is a summary of projects I have done, either in school or on my own. Provided is a title, a couple core concepts demonstrated in the project, and a more detailed description. You may see descriptions for files that are not public; I either haven't uploaded them yet or I'm keeping them private and can show them to you upon request.

## **Data Structure Sample**
### **Data Structure Concepts: Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables**
### FILES: DataStructureSample.cpp, fNames_UK_1841, lNames_UK_1841, nameHashTable.h, nameHashTable.cpp, BST.h
This project demonstrates some of the features of Binary Search Trees and Hash Tables using a couple lists of names gathered from 1841 census data in the UK. I got the data from:
  https://www.freecen.org.uk/freecen2_contents?locale=en
The driver file walks the user through a series of actions that help visualize the contents of the data structures, particularly how chained collision resolution looks in the hash tables. The basis for this program was a couple different school projects, plus a new driver file and a little massaging of the code in the class files.

## **Mathketball Project**
### **Database Concepts: MySQL Workbench Database with Java Front End**
I did this project with two classmates in our Databases class. It represents a proof of concept for a fantasy basetball league that would be run by teachers on behalf of students, with the simulated game being used as a discussion tool for teaching math. The project contains a fully implemented relational database in MySQL Workbench, including relevant tables, a diagram, and some stored procedures.
Also included is a Java program that presents a GUI and allows the user to run some queries we made. The skeleton of the program was provided to us, and myself and my team each implemented a handful of queries that the user can select from.
NOTE: This one is on my personal machine, and is not yet uploaded

## **Bank Account Project**
### **Object Oriented Concepts: Polymorphism and Inheritance**
### FILES: BankAccount.cpp, BankAccount.h, CS132 HW4v2 - Bank Accounts Try 2, Data.txt
This project demonstrates the object-oriented concepts of polymorphism and inheritance. Bank account types are defined in BankAccount.h and implemented in BankAccount.cpp. There is a parent class BankAccount, which contains features common to every type of account: simple savings, advanced savings, checking or credit. Each of these account types are a child class of BankAccount with their own particular rules.
The driver file was will read sample data from Data.txt to generate a few accounts, and give the user a chance to manipulate them.
