**Bank Account Project**\n
This project demonstrates the object-oriented concepts of polymorphism and inheritance. Bank account types are defined in BankAccount.h and implemented in BankAccount.cpp. There is a parent class BankAccount, which contains features common to every type of account: simple savings, advanced savings, checking or credit. Each of these account types are a child class of BankAccount with their own particular rules.\n
The driver file was will read sample data from Data.txt to generate a few accounts, and give the user a chance to manipulate them.
