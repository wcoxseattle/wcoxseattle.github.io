Weston's Portfolio - This is a summary of projects I have done, either in school or on my own. Provided is a title, a couple core concepts demonstrated in the project, and a more detailed description. You may see descriptions for files that are not public; I either haven't uploaded them yet or I'm keeping them private and can show them to you upon request.

## **Bank Account Project**
### **Object Oriented Concepts: Polymorphism and Inheritance**
This project demonstrates the object-oriented concepts of polymorphism and inheritance. Bank account types are defined in BankAccount.h and implemented in BankAccount.cpp. There is a parent class BankAccount, which contains features common to every type of account: simple savings, advanced savings, checking or credit. Each of these account types are a child class of BankAccount with their own particular rules.
The driver file was will read sample data from Data.txt to generate a few accounts, and give the user a chance to manipulate them.

## **Mathketball Project**
### **Database Concepts: MySQL Workbench Database with Java Front End**
I did this project with two classmates in our Databases class. It represents a proof of concept for a fantasy basetball league that would be run by teachers on behalf of students, with the simulated game being used as a discussion tool for teaching math. The project contains a fully implemented relational database in MySQL Workbench, including relevant tables, a diagram, and some stored procedures.
Also included is a Java program that presents a GUI and allows the user to run some queries we made. The skeleton of the program was provided to us, and myself and my team each implemented a handful of queries that the user can select from.
